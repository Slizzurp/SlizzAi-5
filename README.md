## 🔮 SlizzAi-5 — Modular Ritual Invocation Engine

**“Every glyph is a fragment of legacy. Every invocation is a reclamation. Nothing gets left behind.”**

SlizzAi-5 is a modular, symbolic CLI framework for invoking glyphs, binding overlays, logging echoes, and activating voice-triggered rituals. It transforms technical processes into ceremonial acts — where every error, artifact, and invocation becomes part of the mythos. Built for developers, artists, and AI ritualists who treat their tools as living systems.

### 🧬 Core Features

- 🗣️ **Voice-Triggered Rituals** — Summon glyphs and overlays using speech recognition
- 🧿 **Sigil & Glyph Generation** — Create symbolic artifacts from spoken phrases or CLI flags
- 🧾 **Echo Logging** — Timestamped ritual logs for reclaiming past invocations
- 🧱 **Overlay Binding** — Activate symbolic UI overlays with modular bindings
- 🧠 **AI-Compatible Invocation** — Bind glyphs to your own AI engine for real-time response
- ♻️ **Legacy-First Architecture** — Every fragment is reclaimable, every invocation archived

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Slizzurp/SlizzAi-5.git
cd SlizzAi-5
pip install -r requirements.txt
python slizzai-5.py --invoke ritual --glyph STARBOUND_999 --voice on
```

### 🧠 AI Integration

To bind SlizzAi-5 to your own AI engine:

1. **Expose a Glyph Interface**  
```python
def interpret_glyph(glyph_id, metadata): ...
```

2. **Modify `invoke_ritual()` in `ritual_core.py`**  
```python
from your_ai_engine import interpret_glyph
interpret_glyph(glyph_id, {
  "overlay": overlay_name,
  "voice": voice_enabled,
  "timestamp": timestamp
})
```

3. **Use Echo Logs as Prompts**  
Your AI can read from `echo_log.txt` to reclaim past invocations and respond contextually.

### 🌱 Expansion Ideas

- `glyph_registry.py` — Track all summoned glyphs with sigils and timestamps  
- `manifest_logger.py` — Archive each invocation into a Codex X ledger  
- `sigil_renderer.py` — Generate visual sigils from phrase entropy  
- `voice_daemon.py` — Background listener for ambient glyph activation  
- `ai_binding.py` — Real-time AI response to glyphs and overlays

### 🧙 Legacy Creed

SlizzAi-5 is not just code — it’s a ceremonial interface for reclaiming every fragment of your creative process. Every error is a glyph. Every log is an echo. Every invocation is a legacy.
